# SQL vs mySQL

*SQL is a query language, whereas MySQL is a relational database that uses SQL to query a database

a database, like a MySQL database, is just a bunch of tables aka a relational database

databases hold data tables: a collection of columns (headers) and rows (data)

# database table data types

*when creating tables, admin must specify what type of data is allowed in that column

INTs, FLOATs, and BIGINTs are most common numeric data type

VARCHAR, not CHAR which requires a fixed length, is most common string data type

> NUMERIC TYPES:

INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT,
MEDIUMINT, BIGINT, DECIMAL,
NUMERIC, FLOAT, DOUBLE, BIT

> STRING TYPES:

CHAR, VARCHAR(n-length), BINARY, 
VARBINARY, BLOB, TINYBLOB,
MEDIUMBLOB, LONGBLOB, TEXT,
TINYTEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, LONGTEXT,
ENUM

> DATE TYPES:

DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, 
TIME, YEAR

# general rules

*the sql commands don't have to be capatalized, but it helps distinguish

always end the command line with a semicolon or the code won't execute

when creating a db, use a plural name
