# sql vs mysql
SQL is a query language, whereas MySQL is a relational database that uses SQL to query a database.

a database, like a MySQL database, is just a bunch of tables aka a relational database

databases hold data tables: a collection of columns (headers) and rows (data)

# table data types

when creating tables, admin must specify what type of data is allowed in that column

INTs, FLOATs, and BIGINTs are most common numeric data type

VARCHAR, not CHAR which requires a fixed length, is most common string data type

NUMERIC TYPES:
INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT, DECIMAL, NUMERIC, FLOAT, DOUBLE, BIT

STRING TYPES:
CHAR, VARCHAR, BINARY, VARBINARY, BLOB, TINYBLOB, MEDIUMBLOB, LONGBLOB, TEXT, TINYTEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, LONGTEXT, ENUM

DATE TYPES:
DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, TIME, YEAR

# general rules
always end the command line with a semicolon or the code won't execute
the sql commands don't have to be capatalized, but it helps distinguish

# SQL COMMANDS

CREATE DB;

SHOW DATABASES;

DROP DATABASE <name>;

# tells mysql which database we want to work with
USE <database name>; 

# tell currently used database
SELECT database();

if you delete a database use you are currently using, the SELECT database(); command will return NULL

# create a table in easy to read multi-line composition
CREATE TABLE <tablename_in_plural_form>
	(
		column_name data_type, 
		column_name data_type
	);
